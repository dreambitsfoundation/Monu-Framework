# Monu Framework
## The simplest and hackable Javascript Frontend Framework

## Intro

Monu is a versatile Javascript framework developed on **MVC (Model View Controller)** architechture to provide frontend rendering to your web application.

It is powered by **JQuery** and **Moustache Framework**.


## Installation

It is very easy to install **Monu** in your exising web application.

You need to mention **Mustache CDN** and **Monu CDN** just after you **JQuery** library import.

Mustache. CDN
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mustache.js/2.3.0/mustache.min.js"></script>

```

## Initialisation

To initialise a **Monu Application** you have to create an instance of the object **MonuApp**.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  var app = new MonuApp();
</script>
```

Monu Framework is distributed into three modules **App**, **View** and **Router**

1. **App**
